      I'm a frontend developer based in foggy San Francisco. I enjoy CSS,
      Javacript, UI development, and discovering new techniques for creating
      interesting web interactions and effects.

    <p className="mb-4">
      I've had the pleasure of collaborating with designers and developers to
      launch new products and reimagine existing features. I've worked on design
